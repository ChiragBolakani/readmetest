# **Measure Visual Acuity API**
## Team SecureVision 

## Description
To develop a solution that can be used to conduct eye tests in regions with a lack of space and ambience issues, especially rural areas. 
The main objectives of this project are:
- To come up with a visual acuity measurement app or solution which can give consistent and accurate readings.
- To develop a cost-effective and easy to use solution which can be used in rural areas.
- To develop a solution that can be used by a non-medical field (social) worker/volunteer.

## Requirements
The API, Volunteer application and display application must be connected on the same network.

## Usage
- The display app takes in the patient's details such as their 'Name', 'Age', 'Email', 'Contact' and the IP address of the API server.
- The distance is to be provided between the phone and the patient.
- Finally, volunteer validates if the patient's guess is correct or not. After all the readings are done, the visual acuity is displayed at the end.
